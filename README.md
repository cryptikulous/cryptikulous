Hi, I'm @cryptikulous
I am interested in learning programming languages and collaborating with others, thus developing open source softwares.
I'm currently learning HTML and some Python, a pure beginner..
I'm looking to build software with communities of people with the same interests as me, also learning from the masters.
Fellow Humans can reach me at cryptikulous@tutanota.com
